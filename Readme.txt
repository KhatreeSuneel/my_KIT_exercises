jellyfish.ipynb :
A jupyter notebook that contains implementation of the CNN to perform image classification to the jellyfish dataset available at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types. The CNN architecture to be implemented for the task were provided as : 
1. Convolution layer (32 kernels, 5x5 kernel-size)
2. Activation layer (ReLU)
3. Max pooling layer (pooling size 2x2, stride 2)
4. Dropout layer (dropout probability 0.1)
5. Linear layer (256 neurons)
6. Activation Layer (ReLU)
7. Linear layer (2 neurons)



segmentation.ipynb : 

A jupyter notebook file that performs semantic segmentation based on Convolutional Neural Network. Regarding the CNN architecture, U-nets with a ResNet18 backbone were provided and
pretrained to some extent on the dataset used in this task, with a patch size of 256Ã—256 px.
